After killing a gas station attendant, Ron drives to an old manor in the middle of nowhere where Andrew, an agoraphobic, lives, in order to exchange their car. When he notes that Andrew is a wealthy man, Ron decides to get money from Andrew to travel to Thailand. Andrew notices that Dale resembles his fianc√©e, Gabrielle, who left him six months ago.
